🔹 Objective

To configure and test basic firewall rules using Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, allowing and blocking specific network ports to understand traffic filtering and firewall management.


---

🔹 Tools Used

Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security

Windows Operating System




---

🔹 Steps Performed

✅ Step 1: Open Firewall Configuration Tool

Opened Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security

Navigated to Inbound Rules

Viewed existing firewall rules



---

✅ Step 2: Add Rule to Block Telnet (Port 23)

1. Clicked New Rule


2. Selected Port


3. Selected TCP


4. Chose Specific Local Ports


5. Entered: 23


6. Selected Block the connection


7. Applied rule to All Profiles


8. Named rule: Block telnet port 23


9. Clicked Finish



✔ Rule successfully created and visible under Inbound Rules.


---

✅ Step 3: Add Rule to Allow SSH (Port 22)

1. Clicked New Rule


2. Selected Port


3. Selected TCP


4. Entered: 22


5. Selected Allow the connection


6. Applied to All Profiles


7. Named rule: Allow SSH port 22


8. Clicked Finish



✔ SSH port 22 rule successfully added.


---

✅ Step 4: Verification

Confirmed that:

Port 23 was set to Block

Port 22 was set to Allow


Verified rule status under Inbound Rules panel.



---

✅ Step 5: Remove Test Rule

Selected Block telnet port 23

Clicked Delete

Confirmed deletion


✔ System restored to original state.

🔹 How Firewall Filters Traffic

A firewall filters network traffic based on:

Port number

Protocol (TCP/UDP)

Direction (Inbound/Outbound)

Connection state

Profile (Public/Private/Domain)


When a packet attempts to enter or leave the system:

1. Firewall checks rules.


2. If a matching rule exists:

Allow → Traffic passes

Block → Traffic is dropped



3. If no rule matches → Default policy applies.
